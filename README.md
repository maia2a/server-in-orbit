# Server in Orbit

Welcome to **Server in Orbit**, a project designed to simulate a space-bound server environment, exploring innovative ways to handle computation and data transmission between Earth and satellites.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for efficient data handling and low latency communication.
- **Simulation**: Model realistic server conditions in space.
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable to different computational loads.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Back-end server handling.
- **Express**: Lightweight and fast framework for managing API requests.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time, bidirectional communication for efficient data transfer.
- **Docker**: Containerized environment for easy deployment and scaling.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the server running on your local machine or in a containerized environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/maia2a/server-in-orbit.git
    \`\`\`

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    \`\`\`bash
    cd server-in-orbit
    \`\`\`

3. Install dependencies:

    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    \`\`\`

### Running the Server

#### Locally

To run the server locally:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

#### Docker

To run the server in a Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:

    \`\`\`bash
    docker build -t server-in-orbit .
    \`\`\`

2. Run the Docker container:

    \`\`\`bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 server-in-orbit
    \`\`\`

### Configuration

Customize the server behavior through environment variables:

- `PORT`: Define the port for the server (default: `3000`).
- `SATELLITE_LATENCY`: Simulate satellite latency in milliseconds (default: `500`).

Example:

\`\`\`bash
PORT=8080 SATELLITE_LATENCY=700 npm start
\`\`\`

### WebSocket Communication

The server uses WebSockets for real-time communication. To test the WebSocket:

1. Connect to the WebSocket endpoint:

    \`\`\`ws://localhost:3000\`\`\`

2. Send and receive messages in real-time.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /status`: Check server health.
- `POST /data`: Send data to the server.

## Testing

Run unit tests using:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`
